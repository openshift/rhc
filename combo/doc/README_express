OpenShift Express (RHC)
========

Please stop by #openshift on irc.freenode.net if you have any questions or
comments.  Another good resource are the blogs and forums at
http://openshift.redhat.com


Quickstart
========

DEPENDENCIES: git
              openssh-clients
              ruby (1.8.7 or later)
              rubygems
              json_pure gem (native json is fine too)
              parseconfig gem

Step 1:  Create an rhc domain:

$ rhc-create-domain -n desirednamespace -l rhlogin

Step 2: Create an rhc application:

$ rhc-create-app -l rhlogin -a appname -r /path/to/new/git/repo -t <framework Ex: php-5.3>

Once that's complete, follow the directions printed at the end of running
rhc-create-app


Updating your site
========

Once your site is created, updating it is as simple as making changes to your
git repo.  Commit them, then push.  For example:

$ edit index.php
$ git commit -a -m "what I did"
$ git push

Then just reload your web page to see the changes

OS X Notes:
-----------

git:
OS X 10.6 comes w/ ssh and ruby, but not with git, unless you have
Xcode 4.0.x installed (as a developer you should have Xcode anyway).
Xcode, however, is not free (unless you are a registered Apple
Developer) and costs around $5 from the Apple App Store.

If you do not have Xcode, you can obtain a pre-packaged version
of git from:

    http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/

Installing git from MacPorts/HomeBrew/Fink/etc requires Xcode.

Now obtain the client code, either via 'git clone' as above
or via the rhc gem.

json_pure gem:
The client tools also make use of JSON as the data set for
I/O, and therefore needs the json ruby gem. Unless you have
Xcode installed, you will need to install json_pure, which
is the 100% ruby version of the JSON gem. If you have Xcode,
you can elect to install either json_pure or the native
json gem.
