Basic Overview
==============

Selinux is the primary mechanism we're using to protect customer applications
from the host operating system as well as from eachother.  The theory used is
very similar to selinux sandboxes.  If you've never played with selinux
sandboxes before they are worth a look before reading the rest of this document.


Common difficulties
===================

STARTING AND STOPPING:

The most common problem that has come up with our selinux sandbox is customer
applications not starting and stopping.  This is because selinux transitions are
fairly complicated.  You want the application to start up with the proper
contexts (via runcon) but simply running as root may result in permission denied
errors (this is good but annoying at times)

This isn't that different to making sure things run as the correct user.  In our
case you need the correct user, type and mcs label.


CUSTOMER APPLICATION ACCESS

The next most common problem will be a customer application not being able to
access something it might need.  Perhaps it can't get to an outbound port or it
needs something from /proc and it cannot access it.  This is going to be a
tricky wire to walk.  We want the customers to do whatever they need, but no
more.  As we open up our beta, we'll be getting lots of requests for access.
All major changes should go through the selinux team for audits and this should
be done regularly.


MCS Labels
==========

One bit of "magic" that we're doing in selinux that is at least less common is
what we're doing with mcs labels.  Every customer gets their own mcs label.
This prevents the running applications from accessing other applications in any
way.

An MCS label is the last part of an selinux context (seen from ls -lZ):

    unconfined_u:object_r:libra_var_lib_t:s0:c2

In the above example the mcs is "s0:c2", the mcs can be expanded on
significantly for example: s0:c2,c9 is also valuable.  They go from 0 to 1023.
One got'cha here is running admin commands, as is done by mcollective or an init
script.  The MCS restrictions are being set in each applications init script via
runcon:

    runcon -t libra_t -l s0:c3

if we ran the init script with a restricted mcs (like s0:c1) the above command
would fail because s0:c1 != s0:c3.  To get around this restriction, we need to
use an mcs that has a range.  For example, to restart the master
/etc/init.d/libra script one would need to run:

    runcon -l s0-s0:c0.c1023 /etc/init.d/libra

The "runcon -l s0-s0:c0.c1023" will be common for us when doing admin functions
either via scripts called by the system (init scripts) or scripts called by
mcollective.  However, when we run individual user applications, we'll be
narrowing down to their domain with just s0:c3.


How to find an MCS label for a user
===================================

SELinux leaves it up to admins to determin what mcs label should be where.  In
our case we're using uid - 499.  So uid 500 has an mcs of "s0:c1" and uid 501
has an mcs of "s0:c2"


The Labels
==========

libra_t: Our primary libra type, all running customer apps should be of type
    libra_t
libra_var_lib_t: Most customer files should be labeled libra_var_lib_t


The Files
=========
libra.fc: The libra file context list
libra.if: The libra interface (so other policies can interface with libra if
            need be.
libra.te: The actual libra policy rules
libra.pp: The compiled libra policy
libra.sh: The script that automatically compiles a new libra.pp and installs it
