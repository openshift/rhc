Tito (https://github.com/dgoodwin/tito) is the tool that we use to coordinate
our RPM build strategy with git tagging.  Tito supports local builds to ease
development usage of RPMs as well as automatic submission to Brew / Koji.

Here is how you would use tito to build and release the 'broker' project.

# Get into the directory that has the appropriate spec
cd broker

# Make your changes
...

# Commit your changes
git commit -a -m "My changes"

# If you want to get an RPM built with your changes
# use the --test flag to build off the latest
tito build --rpm --test

# Now, you'll want to tag your work and bump the RPM version
tito tag

# Usually after this you need to push your tags live
git pull
git push && git push --tags

# Lastly, do your build in Brew
tito build --cvs-release

Now, if you know that there are lots of changes, you can use tito to figure
out which packages have committed changes since their last tag.  To do this
run:

tito report --untagged-commits | grep rhc-

That's it!


Power Users:

If you know you don't want to get prompted, here is a simple script to tag and release a package:

#!/bin/bash

# Setup an answer file
echo -e "y\nn" > /tmp/answerfile

# Remove your workdir
rm -rf /tmp/tito/cvswork/rhc*

# Tag a package with no prompt
tito tag --accept-auto-changelog

git pull && git push && git push --tags

# To build the package
tito build --cvs-release < /tmp/answerfile

Building an older build:

If you hit the case where you need to build something that has already been tagged and built, you'll need to manually untag stuff before it.  Mash uses the latest tagged NVR, so use this command to untag the more recent versions:

brew untag-pkg libra-rhel-6.1-candidate $nvr
