Purpose: provide information on how to do brew builds.

BUILD BASICS:
============
cvs -d :gserver:cvs.devel.redhat.com:/cvs/dist co $pkg
cd $pkg/RHEL-6-LIBRA
make tag
make build

Import a new package
====================

To import a new package first you need the common module:

cvs -d :gserver:cvs.devel.redhat.com:/cvs/dist co common

Then cd common and run:

./cvs-import.sh -b devel /path/to/srpm

Next ask release-engineering@redhat.com to create a RHEL-6-LIBRA branch for that package.  Then follow
the directions in BUILD BASICS above.

Brew hierarchy
==============
rhel-6-libra-build
├─rhel-6-libra-override
│ └─rhel-6-libra-candidate
│ └─rhel-6-libra
└─RHEL-6-build
└─RHEL-6.0-Z-build
└─RHEL-6.0-Z-override
└─RHEL-6.0-Z
└─RHEL-6.0

Brew interaction
================

To use brew, yum install koji.  Then create a file ~/.koji/brew-config with the
following content:
START
[koji]

authtype = kerberos
;configuration for koji cli tool

;url of XMLRPC server
server = http://brewhub.devel.redhat.com/brewhub

;url of web interface
weburl = https://brewweb.devel.redhat.com/

;url of package download site
pkgurl = http://porkchop.devel.redhat.com/brewroot/packages/

EOF

Next create a 'brew wrapper' for koji.  Create another file called "brew" and 
put it in your path (like ~/bin/brew) with the following content:

#!/bin/bash
koji -c ~/.koji/brew-config $@

EOF

chmod +x brew then test it by getting a list of packages maintaned in brew for
li-express by running this command: brew list-pkgs --tag rhel-6-libra


Mash
====
In order to pull the files out of brew you'll need to yum install mash, then
copy misc/li-mash.conf and misc/libra-rhel-* to /etc/mash/.  Then run:

mash -o /tmp/li -c /etc/mash/li-mash.conf libra-rhel-6.1-candidate

Make sure you have write access to /var/cache/mash
