1. Setup the server and client libraries
  yum install qpid-cpp-server qpid-cpp-client ruby-qmf

2. Disable qpid authentication in /etc/qpidd.conf by setting
  auth=no

2. Start the process
  service qpidd start

3. Replace the following sections in /etc/mcollective/client.cfg and
/etc/mcollective/server.cfg:

  connector = stomp
  plugin.stomp.host = localhost
  plugin.stomp.port = 6163
  plugin.stomp.user = mcollective
  plugin.stomp.password = marionette

 with:

  connector = amqp
  plugin.amqp.url = localhost:5672
  plugin.amqp.ha-url = localhost:5674

4. Restart MCollective to load the new plugin

  service mcollective restart

5. Test by running (you should get at least one result)

  mc-ping

6. You probably want to setup the client logger in /etc/mcollective/client.cfg
  logfile = /var/www/libra/broker/log/mcollective-client.log

7. For debugging, you also want to set 'loglevel = debug' in both /etc/mcollective/client.cfg and /etc/mcollective/server.cfg
