.SH "NAME"
express.conf \- configuration file for OpenShift
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
Search order (on a per variable basis):

1) ~/.openshift/express.conf (Created on first usage of rhc client tools and can be customized per system user)

2) /etc/openshift/express.conf (RPM install path)

3) <ruby_gem_dir>/gems/rhc\-<version>/conf/express.conf (RubyGem install path)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B express.conf
contains the following configuration params:

.I libra_server
The server the rhc client tools communicate with i.e. 
.B https://openshift.redhat.com

.I ssh_key_file
The name of the rsa key file used with your OpenShift applications.  File
should exist under ~/.ssh along with corresponding <ssh_key_file>.pub (Can
also be specified as a full path).  The defaults if not specified are
libra_id_rsa followed by id_rsa.  Ex:
.B libra_id_rsa
Note: If you set this value after creating your domain you'll need to run
.B rhc\-create\-domain \-l <rhlogin> \-n <namespace> \-\-alter
to update the corresponding key in OpenShift.  You'll also want to 
modify the value of IdentityFile in your ~/.ssh/config file 
for the *.rhcloud.com host.


.I debug
Boolean indicating whether debug should always be enabled for the rhc client tools.

.I timeout
Number of seconds before remote operations will timeout.

.I default_rhlogin
