  #
  # highline helper mixin which correctly formats block of say and ask
  # output to have correct margins.  section remembers the last margin
  # used and calculates the relitive margin from the previous section.

  # section(bottom=1) do
  #   say "Hello"
  # end
  #
  # section(top=1) do
  #   say "World"
  # end

  #
  # > Hello
  # >
  # > World 
  #
  # with only one newline between the two.  Biggest margin wins.

  #  top - top margin specified in lines
  #  bottom - bottom margin specified in line
