    summary "Show the authorization tokens for your account"
    description <<-DESC
      Shows the full list of authorization tokens on your account. You 
      can add, edit, or delete authorizations with subcommands.

      An authorization token grants access to the OpenShift REST API with
      a set of privileges called 'scopes' for a limited time.  You can
      add an optional note to each authorization token to assist you in
      remembering what is available.

      Add an authorization to your account. An authorization token grants
      access to the OpenShift REST API with a set of privileges called 'scopes'
      for a limited time.  You can add an optional note to each authorization
      token to assist you in remembering what is available.

      To view the list of scopes supported by this server, run this command
      without any options.

      You may pass multiple scopes to the --scopes option inside of double
      quotes (--scopes \"scope1 scope2\") or by separating them with commas
      (--scopes scope1,scope2).

      The server will enforce a maximum and default expiration that may
      differ for each scope. If you request an expiration longer than the
      server maximum, you will be given the default value.
