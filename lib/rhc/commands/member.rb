      Domain Membership
        Developers can collaborate on applications by adding people or teams to
        domains as members. Each member has a role (admin, edit, or view),
        and those roles determine what the user can do with the domain and the
        applications contained within.

        Domain Member Roles

          view  - able to see the domain and its apps, but not make any changes
          edit  - create, update, and delete applications, and has Git and SSH access
          admin - can update membership of a domain

        The default role granted to domain members is 'edit' - use the '--role' 
        argument to specify a different role. When adding and removing members, you 
        can use their 'login' value (typically their email or a short unique name for
        them), or their 'id'.  Both login and ID are visible via the 'rhc account' 
        command.

        To see existing members of a domain or application, use:

          rhc members -n DOMAIN_NAME [-a APP_NAME]

        To change the role for a domain member, simply call the update-member command 
        with the new role. You cannot change the role of the owner.

      Team Membership
        People who typically share the same role can be added to a team. The team can
        then be added as a member of a domain, and all of the people in the team will
        inherit the team's role on the domain.

        If a person is a member of multiple teams which are members of a domain, or
        is also added as a domain member individually, their effective role is the 
        higher of their individual role or their teams' roles on the domain.

        Team Member Roles
          view  - able to see information about the team and its members, and
                  has access to all domains the team is a member of

        To see existing members of a team, use:

          rhc members -t TEAM_NAME

      Domain Membership
