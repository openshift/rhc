    summary "Commands for deploying and managing deployments of an application"
    description <<-DESC
      By default OpenShift applications prepare, distribute, and activate deployments
      on every git push. Alternatively, a user may choose to disable automatic
      deployments and use this 'rhc deployment' set of commands to fully control the
      deployment lifecycle. Use these commands to deploy manually from a git reference
      or from a binary file, list and display deployments and also activate existing
      deployments. Check also 'rhc configure-app' to configure your application to
      deploy manually.
